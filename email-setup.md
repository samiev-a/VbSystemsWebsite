# Email Setup for Contact Form

The contact form will now send emails when submitted. To enable email functionality, you need to set up environment variables for email service.

## Gmail SMTP Setup (Recommended for Testing)

1. **Enable 2-Factor Authentication** on your Gmail account
2. **Generate an App Password**:
   - Go to Google Account settings
   - Security â†’ 2-Step Verification â†’ App passwords
   - Generate a new app password for "Mail"
   - Copy the 16-character password

3. **Set Environment Variables** in Replit:
   - Go to your Replit project settings
   - Add these secrets:
     - `EMAIL_USER`: Your Gmail address (e.g., yourname@gmail.com)
     - `EMAIL_PASS`: The 16-character app password from step 2
     - `EMAIL_HOST`: smtp.gmail.com (optional, defaults to Gmail)
     - `EMAIL_PORT`: 587 (optional, defaults to 587)

## How It Works

When a contact form is submitted:
1. âœ… The form data is saved to the database
2. ðŸ“§ **Two emails are sent**:
   - **To You**: Contains all contact details and message
   - **To Customer**: Confirmation email with next steps

## Testing

1. Set up the environment variables above
2. Submit a test form on your website
3. Check both your email and the test email address for messages

## Security Notes

- App passwords are safer than your main Gmail password
- Environment variables keep credentials secure
- Emails are sent via secure SMTP connection

## Alternative Email Services

You can also use:
- **Outlook/Hotmail**: smtp.outlook.com (port 587)
- **Yahoo**: smtp.mail.yahoo.com (port 587)
- **Custom SMTP**: Any email provider with SMTP access

Just update the EMAIL_HOST environment variable accordingly.
